# Content Template

Content Templates standardize the display format of various content provided by CIC. Sometimes your client may have to display additional content on its screen in addition to speaking the results provided by Clova. When Clova sends data to your client, it should send in a pre-defined format using the Content Templates. Content Templates can help your client display data in a proper manner.

Currently, Clova is providing the following Content Templates.

* [CardList](/CIC/References/ContentTemplates/CardList.md)
* [ImageList](/CIC/References/ContentTemplates/ImageList.md)
* [ImageText](/CIC/References/ContentTemplates/ImageText.md)
* [Text](/CIC/References/ContentTemplates/Text.md)
