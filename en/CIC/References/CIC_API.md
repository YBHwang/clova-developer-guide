# CIC API
CIC categorizes [Event messages](/CIC/References/Message_Format.md#Event) and [Directive messages](CIC/References/Message_Format.md#Directive) into several namespaces by their functionalities and provides them as the CIC APIs. Your client should use these APIs to create an Event message for CIC or to interpret a message received from CIC.

CIC provides the following namespaces.

* [Alerts](/CIC/References/APIs/Alerts.md)
* [AudioPlayer](/CIC/References/APIs/AudioPlayer.md)
* [Clova](/CIC/References/APIs/Clova.md)
* [Memo](/CIC/References/APIs/Memo.md)
* [PlaybackController](/CIC/References/APIs/PlaybackController.md)
* [Reminder](/CIC/References/APIs/Reminder.md)
* [SpeechRecognizer](/CIC/References/APIs/SpeechRecognizer.md)
* [SpeechSynthesizer](/CIC/References/APIs/SpeechSynthesizer.md)

See the following index for the full list of Event and Directive messages.
