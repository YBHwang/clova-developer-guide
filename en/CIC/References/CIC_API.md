# CIC API
CIC categorizes [event messages](/CIC/References/Message_Format.md#Event) and [directive messages](CIC/References/Message_Format.md#Directive) into namespaces by their functions and provides them as the CIC APIs. You use these APIs to create event messages to send to CIC or to interpret messages returned from CIC.

CIC provides the following namespaces.

* [Alerts](/CIC/References/APIs/Alerts.md)
* [AudioPlayer](/CIC/References/APIs/AudioPlayer.md)
* [Clova](/CIC/References/APIs/Clova.md)
* [Memo](/CIC/References/APIs/Memo.md)
* [PlaybackController](/CIC/References/APIs/PlaybackController.md)
* [Reminder](/CIC/References/APIs/Reminder.md)
* [SpeechRecognizer](/CIC/References/APIs/SpeechRecognizer.md)
* [SpeechSynthesizer](/CIC/References/APIs/SpeechSynthesizer.md)

See the following indexes for a full list of event and directive messages.
