## Preparation {#Preparation}
Your client should connect with CIC using the HTTP/2 protocol. To do so, you need to prepare the following.

* [Libraries](#RequiredLibrary) for HTTP/2 protocol connection
* [Client credentials](#ClientAuthInfo) for creation of a Clova access token


### Required library {#RequiredLibrary}
You are recommended to use the following libraries for client development to allow communications over the HTTP/2 protocol connection.

| Programming language | Library  |
|---------|------------------------------------|
| C/C++  | [nghttp2](https://nghttp2.org/), [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) |
| Java  | [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/), [Netty](http://netty.io/), [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) |


### Client credentials {#ClientAuthInfo}
To use any services provided by Clova, the user must authenticate his or her NAVER account in your client. With the NAVER account information provided by the user, your client can obtain an access token for the NAVER account. Following that, the token is delivered to the Clova authorization server, from where a Clova access token is issued (See [Creating Clova access token](#CreateClovaAccessToken)).

When the NAVER account access token is sent to the authorization server, client credentials obtained in the Clova Developer Console should be provided together (use [Clova Auth API](/CIC/References/Clova_Auth_API.md)). As such, make sure to obtain client credentials in the Clova Developer Console and have it ready in advance. Client credentials include the following.

| Credentials  | Description  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| CLOVA_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID  | The client ID registered in the Clova Developer Console  |
| CLOVA_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET | The client authentication key obtained in the Clova Developer Console |
